## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Blank Page or White Screen
**Cause:** Using Visual editor instead of Text/Code editor  
**Fix:**
1. Switch to Text or Code editor (look for tab at top)
2. Delete everything
3. Re-paste the complete code
4. Save and refresh

### Problem: Fullscript Catalog Not Showing
**Cause:** iframe loading delay or URL issue  
**Fix:**
1. Wait 10 seconds (first load takes time)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify URL: https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/integrohealth/store-start
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode
5. Clear browser cache

### Problem: Loading Spinner Won't Disappear
**Cause:** Slow internet or Fullscript server delay  
**Fix:**
- Normal for first load (5-10 seconds)
- If persistent after 30 seconds:
  - Check internet connection
  - Verify Fullscript store is active
  - Try different browser
  - Contact Fullscript support

### Problem: Layout Broken on Mobile
**Cause:** Theme CSS overriding styles  
**Fix:**
Add wrapper to line 1:
```html
<div style="all: initial;">
<!-- your code here -->
</div>
```

### Problem: Checkout Doesn't Work
**Expected Behavior:** Patients are redirected to Fullscript for secure checkout  
**Why:** Required by Fullscript's terms for compliance  
**Action:** No fix needed - this is correct!
