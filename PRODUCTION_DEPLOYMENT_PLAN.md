## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: "Blank page or white screen"
**Cause:** Using Visual editor instead of Text/Code editor  
**Solution:**
1. Switch to Text/Code editor
2. Delete all content
3. Re-paste complete code
4. Save and refresh

### Problem: "Fullscript catalog not showing"
**Cause:** Loading delay or URL issue  
**Solution:**
1. Wait 10-15 seconds (first load takes time)
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify URL: https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/integrohealth/store-start
4. Try incognito/private browsing
5. Clear browser cache

### Problem: "Loading spinner won't disappear"
**Cause:** Slow internet or Fullscript server delay  
**Solution:**
- Normal for first load (5-10 seconds)
- If persistent after 30 seconds:
  - Check internet connection
  - Verify Fullscript store is active
  - Try different browser
  - Contact Fullscript support

### Problem: "Layout broken on mobile"
**Cause:** Theme CSS conflicts  
**Solution:**
Add wrapper to line 1 of code:
```html
<div style="all: initial;">
<!-- your code here -->
</div>
```

### Problem: "Checkout doesn't work"
**Expected Behavior:** Patients redirect to Fullscript for checkout  
**Why:** Required by Fullscript for security and compliance  
**Action:** No fix needed - this is correct behavior!
