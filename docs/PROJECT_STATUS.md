## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Implementation
- **Public catalog only** - No personalization yet
- **Basic embed** - Limited customization
- **Fullscript checkout** - Patients redirect for payment
- **No patient auth** - Anyone can browse
- **No order tracking** - Lives in Fullscript only

### Future Enhancements Needed For:
- Personalized product recommendations
- Treatment plan integration
- Patient-specific pricing
- Order history in WordPress
- Custom product filtering
- Practitioner product approval
- Advanced analytics

**Note:** Current implementation is perfect for starting. Upgrade features can be added later as needed.

---

## üîê COMPLIANCE STATUS

### Current Compliance Level: ‚úÖ PUBLIC CATALOG
**What this means:**
- No PHI is stored or transmitted
- No patient authentication required
- No Business Associate Agreement needed
- SSL certificate sufficient
- Low compliance burden

### Required Compliance Measures:
- [x] SSL/TLS certificate active
- [x] Fullscript terms accepted
- [x] Privacy policy updated (if needed)
- [ ] Patient notification (optional)

### NOT Required Right Now:
- ‚ùå Business Associate Agreement
- ‚ùå HIPAA compliance infrastructure
- ‚ùå Encrypted database
- ‚ùå Access controls
- ‚ùå Audit logging
- ‚ùå Security risk assessment

### When You'll Need More:
**IF you add these features:**
- Patient authentication
- Personalized recommendations
- Treatment plan integration
- Storing patient data
- Custom pricing

**THEN you'll need:**
- Business Associate Agreement with Fullscript
- HIPAA-compliant backend server
- Encrypted database
- Access controls and audit logs
- Security risk assessment
- Incident response plan

## üìù DECISION LOG

### October 23, 2025 - Architecture Decision
**Decision:** Branded embed (Option 2) over simple iframe (Option 1) or custom backend (Option 3)

**Reasoning:**
- Fastest implementation (30-45 min)
- Professional appearance
- Zero backend complexity
- Minimal compliance requirements
- Easy to upgrade later
- Meets immediate business need

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Simple iframe - Too basic, not branded
2. Custom OAuth backend - Too complex for initial launch
3. WordPress plugin - Unnecessary overhead

**Outcome:** Implemented branded embed approach
